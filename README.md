# ML-Notebooks

## Introduction

This repo uses Jupyter Notebooks to showcase different machine learning (ML) and data analysis models. I hope to be able to use this repo as a way to showcase different models that are fundamental to machine learning. This is a repo that will be under construction for a long time as there are many concepts and ideas when it comes to ML. Some of the concepts may seem trivial and easy but everybody has their own starting point.

I am also creating this repo as a sort of reference guide for myself and for other enthusiasts. I believe having a one-stop-shop for multiple models and showcasing how they are implemented in Python is very helpful.

If you have any recommendations or topics you would like to see covered, feel free to reach out to me!
